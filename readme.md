# Welcome to the Wandelbots Git-Workshop

# SkipCommit Task
## Explanation
You branched from a colleagues branch and the colleague promised to not change the history. It happened anyway. Now you want to rebase your branch but skip the wrong commit

## Steps
- Checkout skip/main
- Checkout skip/feature
- Interactive rebase skip/feature on skip/main
- Drop the commit you want to get rid of
- Finish rebase and push your changes
