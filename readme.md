# Challenge
## Explanation
This challenge is to combine your past learned knowledge in one task

## Steps
- You have two branches challenge/main and challenge/feature
- Rebase challenge/feature on challenge/main
- Add to commits to the rebased branch
- Combine the two commits to one
- You noticed the rebase was wrong and you want to move the combined commit to the state before the rebase
- You now want to create a new branch from the rebased state
- Commit to the new branch
