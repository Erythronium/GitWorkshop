# Change Branch Task 2
## Explanation
You committed to the wrong branch. Move your changes to a different branch.
Main branch can not be forced push to, so you have to revert the changes.

## Steps
- Checkout changeBranch2/main
- You find a commit you want to move to a different branch
- Soft reset the last commit
- Checkout changeBranch2/feature
- Commit the changes
- Checkout changeBranch2/main
- Revert the last commit
